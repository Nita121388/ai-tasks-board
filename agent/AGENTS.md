# AGENTS.md - AI Tasks Board Agent Workspace

This folder is the **Agent workspace** for AI Tasks Board.

If you're running the runtime locally, this is where the Agent's **Soul / Memory / Heartbeat** live.

## Every Session (Recommended)

1. Read `SOUL.md` — persona and boundaries
2. Read `USER.md` — who you're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) — short-term continuity
4. (Optional) Read `MEMORY.md` — curated long-term memory
5. Read `HEARTBEAT.md` — what background checks should run

## What Gets Generated

- Daily logs: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Heartbeat state: `memory/heartbeat-state.json`
- Optional history snapshots: `history/`

These are intended to be **machine-local** (and are gitignored by default).
